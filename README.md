## Titanic
I got some insight on what to do about the missing data. We should replace it with the mean of the feature, rather than an arbitrary number.

Also I just learned that decision trees are a good way of classifying quantitave and categorical data, which would help us for things like 'embarked' and possibly 'cabin'. Using this would reduce the amount of arbitrary choices we make in the preprocessing data step.
